			<h3>Art and UI Design Update</h3>
			<p>Our artists have been hard at work updating the UI design and sprite assets. In the previous phase, our UI was getting a 
			little cluttered which made it difficult for future updates or additions to the UI. Some of the art assets are being updated
			to fit a variety of aspect ratios at the moment as well. Along with this update, there was the implementation of a visual UI
			element for blood need.</p> 
			
			<image src="assets/ui_update.png" alt="UIUpdate" style="width:691px;height:326px;"/>
			
			<h3>Code Restructuring and Planning</h3>
			<p>We have done a restructure of our code. We have made our "player" class a manager class that is implemented using the singleton
			design pattern (safe with unity) with future plans of incorporating thread safe capabilities. Inventory and item classes were 
			improved heavily to make expanding their concepts in future updates easier.</p> 
			
			<p>The team is currently testing or working on these concepts for future updates:
			<ul>
				<li>Priority Queue for Crop Growth Progress</li>
				<li>Animations for Crop Growth Progress and Completion</li>
				<li>Observer Pattern for Events and Order Completions</li>
				<li>Upgrade, Harvest, etc. UI menu and mechanics for strucutres.</li> 
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Placing Structures</h3>
			<p>Structures can now be placed upon the grid through a drag and drop as well as removed. Currently there is testing in place
			for work regarding user friendly model for removal and moving.</p>
			
			<image src="assets/structures.gif" alt="Structures">
			
			<h3>Structure Shop</h3>
			<p>Structures that can be placed on the grid are now available for purchase. Structures can be bought and placed as it updates inventory
			and currentcy. </p>
			
			<image src="assets/shop.gif" alt="Shop">
			
			<h2>What's Next?</h2>
			<p>Next steps would be to continue planning and testing for future updates regarding in progress mechanics and additions. 
			The team has a focus on crop harvesting and planting. Next step would be to implement orders and also adding new resources 
			and structures past the wheat crop and the town homes.</p>
			
			<h2>Pase 1 of 4 [THIS IS OLD NEWS AS OF 8/10/21]</h2>
			
			<h3>Developer/Artist Recruitment</h3>
			<p>Campaign for more artists and developers to join the project</p>
			
			<h3>Main Menu</h3>
			<p>Current progress regarding the main menu includes a working "new game" button and exit button as well as the menu 
			retaining its position/mindfulness of other objects with changes in resolution. 
			Check out a visual below: </p>
			
			<img src="assets/menu.gif" alt="MenuVisual"/>
			
			<h3>Camera</h3>
			<p>Players can navigate the plain (within bounds) using their mouse, arrow keys or wasd keys. They may also zoom using 
			the +/- keys and their mouse scroll wheel. 
			Check out a visual below:</p>
			
			<img src="assets/camera.gif" alt="CameraVisual"/>
			
			<h3>Player Attributes</h3>
			<p>Players now have (in the background) attributes associated to them such as the number of citizens within their town, 
			their town name, what level they are, etc. Currently because there isn't gameplay or visuals regarding these mechanics yet, 
			there isn't a visual to view.</p>
			
			<h3>Inventory Panels</h3>
			<p>A very primitive set up with the inventory with displaying what is stored is implemented. It allows players to filter based on 
			the type of resource as well as scroll through and navigate their resources/structures/decor items. In a soon update, there will be
			a way for users to navigate to a shop to purchase structures and items. Check out a quick visual below:</p>
